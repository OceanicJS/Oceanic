Visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xZ4AhdYrf9) when adding features that are not immediately related to Discord's API, and [look at](https://github.com/OceanicJS/Oceanic/pulls) the existing pull requests before opening a new pull request.

Guidelines:
* If a pull requestis already opened, regardless if abandoned or otherwise, do not duplicate it.
* If a feature had been rejected previously, do not attempt to suggest it again.
* An understanding of typescript, types, and how to use these effectively is required for contributing.
* Pull Requests should always target the `dev` branch.
* Ensure you are following the eslint rules. You can use `npm run lint` & `npm run lint:fix` to test locally.
* If any of the tests fail on your pull request, attempt to understand why. Your pull request will not be merged without all three tests passing. (test code, test docs, lint)
* Don't be hostile.
